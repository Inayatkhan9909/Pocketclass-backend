# PocketClass Booking System

## Project Overview

The PocketClass Booking System is a platform designed to connect students with instructors specializing in sports, arts, and music. The system provides both students and instructors with a streamlined experience for managing and booking classes, inspired by platforms like Airbnb and Calendly. 

### Features
- **Instructor Interface**: Manage availability, view bookings, and edit or cancel scheduled slots.
- **Student Interface**: View real-time availability of instructors, book slots, and receive booking confirmations.
- **Conflict Prevention**: Prevents double-booking through real-time updates and transaction locks.
- **Scalability and User Experience**: Designed for a seamless experience with efficient data handling and a scalable Firebase backend.

### Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React, Tailwind CSS, Material-UI, Firebase.
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express, Firebase Admin SDK, and dotenv for environment management.


###  PocketClass Booking System â€“ Backend
- **Overview
This backend system is designed to support the PocketClass Booking System, allowing instructors to set their availability and students to book classes in areas such as sports, arts, and music. The backend is built using Node.js and Firebase to handle data management, authentication, and scheduling.

- **Features**
- **User Authentication:** Secure authentication using Firebase and hashed passwords.
- **Booking Management:** CRUD operations for instructor availability and student bookings.
- **Conflict Prevention:** Real-time updates to prevent double-booking and scheduling conflicts.
- **CORS Support:** Configured to allow cross-origin requests from the frontend.
- **Scripts**
json
Copy code
{
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1",
    "dev": "nodemon index.js"
  }
}
- **test:** Displays an error message if no tests are specified.
- **dev:** Runs the backend server in development mode using nodemon, which reloads on code changes.
